    "description": "# HSW parametric hook\n\nThis is a small parametric hook for the honeycomb storage wall.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThis is a parametric recreation of [Small hook (for Honeycomb Storage Wall)](https://www.printables.com/model/259531-small-hook-for-honeycomb-storage-wall) by DusBus which is in turn based on [Honeycomb storage wall](https://www.printables.com/model/152592-honeycomb-storage-wall) created by RostaP.\n\n## Print instructions\n\nLike all HSW inserts, I've printed this with 4 perimeters and 20% infill. I've used a 0.4mm nozzle and 0.2mm layer height. I've printed this in PLA, but PETG or ABS should work as well.\n\nDespite getting a warning in PrusaSlicer I was able to print this on an Prusa MK4 without supports or brim without any issues.\n\n## License\n\nThis work is licensed under [Creative Commons - Attribution - Non-Commercial](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/).",
