# HSW parametric hook

This is a small parametric hook for the honeycomb storage wall.

## Acknowledgements

This is a parametric recreation of [Small hook (for Honeycomb Storage Wall)](https://www.printables.com/model/259531-small-hook-for-honeycomb-storage-wall) by DusBus which is in turn based on [Honeycomb storage wall](https://www.printables.com/model/152592-honeycomb-storage-wall) created by RostaP.

## Print instructions

Like all HSW inserts, I've printed this with 4 perimeters and 20% infill. I've used a 0.4mm nozzle and 0.2mm layer height. I've printed this in PLA, but PETG or ABS should work as well.

Despite getting a warning in PrusaSlicer I was able to print this on an Prusa MK4 without supports or brim without any issues.
